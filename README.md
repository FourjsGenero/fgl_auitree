# fgl_auitree
Library functions that are useful to interrogate and manipulate the AUI Tree

## Instructions
Run the program, and then look at the code that is behind the scenes for any functionality you are interested in

This program used to include a generic list example, that has been ported off to fgl_zoom.  Might do the same for the generic menu example

## TODO
The arraycopy can now be done a lot simpler

Rewrite to use IMPORT FGL so that developer can simply import the AUI code as a library

Port off generic_menu as a seperate library
