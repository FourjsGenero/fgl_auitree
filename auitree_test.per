{
This program gives some examples of where AUI (or DOM) tree manipulation has 
been used to achieve a particular outcome.
[" "]
Before attempting to learn aspects of this manipulation, you should start the
GDC with the -D command line option specified and be familiar with what happens
if you press Control and right-click on a widget. Any manipulation we are doing
is essentially a case of finding one or more of the nodes in the tree and
reading and changing one of the attribute values.
[" "]
In creating this example I came across a number of instance where 4Js has 
implemented a function that I had forgotten existed. So with every release
keep an eye on ui.form and ui.Dialog classes to see what methods are there
for you to use. 
[" "]
DISCLAIMER
4Js may change the AUI tree between Genero releases. Ensure that you test any
library routines you create with each new release.

Whilst methods exist to set attributes, the methods to get them may not be
present. This example uses the function field_hidden_get() to determine the
current hidden attribute before using the official method to either
hide or unhide the element.

Construct [dt01       ]

[" "]
Click the button and the code reads the dialog type so that we can respond 
differently if in a CONSTRUCT or an INPUT. An example maybe in a zoom window 
where you may allow multiple selection in a CONSTRUCT which you wouldn't in an 
INPUT.

[" "]
Sometimes you may want to work on more than one form element at a time. In this 
example, have used the TAG attribute to select more than one field to
perform the DOM manipulation on.
Personally I dislike using TAG as you can only have one dimension of data in it
and still use XPath. If we had matches in the XPath method it would be more
useful.
Also note this routine hides the field manipulating the DOM directly rather
than using the Genero method. If possibleyou should use the Genero method
where available.
